## About Identity Center

## Prerequisites 

1. Start with a list of the account ids you want as part of your identity center
---- > Link to account ids sensitive info?
---- > owner emails
1. Create an organization

## Step 1: Create an Organization
1. Start in the account you want to manage - like if I lose access to this email the apocolypse has probably happened
1. Click **Create Organization**
2. Verify email address for management account

## Step 2: Add your accounts to the organization


## Step 3: 
- Go to identity center
- You will see your organization under **multi-account permissions**
- Require MFA
- Maximum session duration
- Create user
- sign in as the new user
- set up MFA on first sign in

## Check Identity Center page - you can log in but you don't have any accounts

- Create permission set

## Step 4: 
- Give access to account
- Assign permission set
- 

## Navigate back to Idenity Center log in and boom


## add a new account for cert study using the + trick

## Show using console access credentials by listing s3 buckets - one of the biggest cloud architect geniuses I ever worked with used this trick and I like to copy him so this is the command I always run even though I'm sure getting the caller identity or something would be a better one


## Organizations is free, identity center is free
